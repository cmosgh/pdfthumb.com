# Dashboard Development Plan

This document outlines the phased development plan for the new dashboard feature. The dashboard aims to provide users with a centralized, intuitive interface for monitoring key metrics, managing content/users, and accessing essential settings related to their PDF thumbnail generation service. It will leverage the existing React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite stack.

Each phase is detailed in a separate Markdown file within this directory, including technical specifications and progress tracking checkboxes.
