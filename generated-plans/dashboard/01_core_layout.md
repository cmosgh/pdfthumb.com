# Phase 1: Core Layout & Navigation

**Goal:** Establish the fundamental structure and navigation for the dashboard, providing a consistent user experience across all dashboard sections.

**Technical Details:**

*   **New Directory Structure:**
    *   `src/routes/dashboard/`: Will contain the root dashboard route and its nested children.
    *   `src/components/dashboard/`: Will house reusable UI components specific to the dashboard.

*   **Components to Create:**
    *   `src/routes/dashboard/__root.tsx`: This will serve as the root layout for all dashboard-related routes. It will likely import and render `DashboardLayout`.
    *   `src/components/dashboard/DashboardLayout.tsx`: A high-level layout component responsible for structuring the dashboard. It should include:
        *   A main content area.
        *   A sidebar for navigation.
        *   Consider a header/navbar specific to the dashboard if different from the main application `Navbar`.
    *   `src/components/dashboard/DashboardSidebar.tsx`: This component will contain the primary navigation links for the various dashboard sections (e.g., Overview, Analytics, Settings).

*   **Routing (TanStack Router):**
    *   **Root Dashboard Route:** A new route should be defined in `src/router.tsx` for `/dashboard`. This route will use `src/routes/dashboard/__root.tsx` as its component.
    *   **Nested Routes:** Define child routes within the `/dashboard` route for each major section (e.g., `/dashboard/overview`, `/dashboard/analytics`, `/dashboard/settings`). These will initially render placeholder components.
    *   **`routeTree.gen.ts`:** This file is automatically generated by TanStack Router based on your file-based routing. Ensure the generation process is working correctly after defining new routes.

*   **Styling (Tailwind CSS):**
    *   Utilize Tailwind's utility classes for flexible box layouts (flexbox) and grid layouts to structure `DashboardLayout.tsx`.
    *   Implement responsive design principles using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) to ensure the layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    *   Ensure consistent padding, margins, and spacing throughout the dashboard.
    *   Consider a subtle background color or pattern for the dashboard area to differentiate it from the main application.

*   **State Management:**
    *   No complex state management is required at this phase beyond basic UI state (e.g., sidebar open/close). React's `useState` and `useContext` (if a global layout context is desired) should suffice.

*   **Testing Considerations:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Test `DashboardSidebar.tsx` to ensure navigation links are rendered correctly and active states are applied.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Use Playwright to verify that the dashboard layout renders correctly, navigation links are clickable, and routing works as expected.

**Checklist:**

*   [ ] Create `src/routes/dashboard/__root.tsx` with a basic structure.
*   [ ] Define the `/dashboard` route in `src/router.tsx` pointing to `src/routes/dashboard/__root.tsx`.
*   [ ] Verify `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is updated correctly after route definition.
*   [ ] Create `src/components/dashboard/DashboardLayout.tsx` with a basic flex/grid layout for sidebar and content.
*   [ ] Create `src/components/dashboard/DashboardSidebar.tsx` with placeholder navigation links.
*   [ ] Implement basic responsiveness for `DashboardLayout.tsx` and `DashboardSidebar.tsx`.
*   [ ] Add placeholder components for nested routes (e.g., `src/routes/dashboard/overview.tsx`, `src/routes/dashboard/analytics.tsx`, `src/routes/dashboard/settings.tsx`).
*   [ ] Write a basic Playwright test to navigate to `/dashboard` and assert the layout is visible.
